        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying </li>
            <li>1 large egg </li>
            <li>1 cup milk </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil </li>
            <li>1 cup pancake mix </li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) package cream-filled chocolate sandwich cookies (such as Oreo®) </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cookies into the batter one at a time, and carefully place into the hot frying oil. Fry only 4 or 5 at a time to avoid overcrowding the deep fryer. Cook until the cookies are golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
