        <p><strong><em>Tired of plain old boring water? Here's a cool and fruity twist on it! Mix up your fruits for a tasty surprise! Citrus fruit and berries work best. If you want more flavor, add more fruits, and if you want less flavor, use less fruit. You can squeeze the juice out to color the water or just put whole slices and berries in. </em></strong></p>
