            <li>1 quart oil for deep frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
            <li>1 egg beaten</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 pound hot dogs</li>
            <li>wooden sticks</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
           <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir in melted bacon drippings. Make a well in the center, and pour in the egg, buttermilk, and baking soda. Mix until everything is smooth and well blended.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Pat the hot dogs dry with paper towels so that the batter will stick. Insert wooden sticks into the ends. Dip the hot dogs in the batter one at a time, shaking off the excess. Deep fry a few at a time in the hot oil until they are as brown as you like them. Drain on paper towels or serve on paper plates.</li>
        </ol>
